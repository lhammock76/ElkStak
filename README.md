# Cloud Network
This a collection of Linux and Ansible Scripts from my Cybersecurity Class through the University of Texas.

Most of the scripts are used to configure cloud servers with different Docker containers.

The final setup was 4 servers running vulnerable DVWA containers along with a jumpbox and server running and ELK Stack Container.
